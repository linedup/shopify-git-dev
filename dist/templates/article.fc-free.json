However, these fluorocarbons slowly leach from the fabrics and gradually find their way into the water system. Over time, they bioaccumulate in the environment and enter the food chain, with the potential to cause health problems for both wildlife and people. <\/p>"

We believed it was attainable and we’re proud to have made it a reality.<\/p><p>Since 2018 we have only used fluorocarbon-free DWRs in all of our outerwear. We currently use two DWRs, one silicone based and an American DWR called Neoseed which contains botanical extracts to repel water without the need for fluorine - both of these DWRs break down naturally in the environment so we can create waterproof fabrics without compromising performance or the environment.<\/p><p>As a business we are by no means perfect, nor do we have all the answers, but in the face of an ever changing landscape, we always seek and commit to the best and most sustainable way of making our product, innovating where necessary.<\/p>"
