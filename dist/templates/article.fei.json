Dealing with down can be difficult, with live plucking common and sourcing chains hard to verify. Synthetic fills also perform better in a variety of conditions, retaining 75% of their warmth when wet compared to only 15% with down insulation. This ensures you're prepared to face anything the coastal climate can throw at you.",
