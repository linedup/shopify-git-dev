It involves stripping the skin from a sheep’s backside to stop flies from laying eggs in the sheep’s wool. It is a painful process for the animal and in many cases the sheep still get Flystrike after being mulesed. We have always used non-mulesed wool for all of our Merino base layers and knitwear.<\/em><\/p>"

We tested and tweaked the formula for years, striving to get the perfect combination of super-soft Merino with enough strength to handle regular washing and retain its shape.<br\/><br\/>Starting with 100% Merino eight years ago, we found that over time the fabric could twist and ladder when worn and washed. To combat this we blended Merino with polyamide to improve strength and durability without affecting its softness. This blend worked extremely well and we stuck with it for years. But we’re constantly striving for better more sustainable product, so we wanted to give you the benefits of our Merino base layers, using only natural technical fibres.<br\/><br\/>We had hoped that Tencel® would be the answer; a cellulosic fibre sourced from sustainable eucalyptus farms. Whilst it performed well, it produced a lighter fabric, more suited as a summer layer than as a replacement for our hardy Merino base layers.<\/p>"

Whilst Merino is antibacterial and can be washed less often, this is a base layer that goes next to your skin, not a jumper. It’s going to need washing. So, here are a few tips for keeping your Merino base layers in top shape.<\/p><p>• Wash at 30°C on a gentle wool cycle with similar colours, keep it on a low spin - max 400.<\/p><p>• Turn your Merino wool garment inside out when washing as this will help prevent it from pilling.<\/p><p>• Do not dry clean or tumble dry.<\/p><p>• Do not bleach or use fabric softener.<\/p><p>• Line dry only away from direct heat.<\/p><p>• Flat dry Merino jumpers as this will help to keep their shape.<\/p><p>• Use a cool iron only if you feel you need to.<\/p><p>• Avoid wringing any Merino wool garment as it will stretch and twist the fabric.<\/p><p>• Our blend does contain synthetic fibres to strengthen the material so, while we’re searching for better alternatives, you may want to invest in a guppy bag for now.<\/p>"
