You should always check the washcare label as different wool garments will require different kinds of care. Some wool clothing may require hand washing, but generally speaking you can machine wash most wool garments at low temperatures.<\/p><p>To wash products such as our Merino Baselayers, knitwear or wool fleeces, wash at 30C and use a gentle wool cycle with no spin, and make sure not to tumble dry. Instead, dry flat and reshape whilst damp for the best results. You should never use bleach to clean wool, and only use a cool iron to finish.<\/p>"

This includes the sourcing of materials and we only deal with certified farms. We also only source 100% guaranteed non-mulesed wool.
