These chemicals can end up in our water systems, food and farm animals which eventually lead to being in our own bodies as carcinogens which can potentially lead to cancer. According to the World Health Organisation, an estimated 20,000 deaths each year are down to pesticide poisoning in developing countries.<\/p><p>Conventional cotton also uses huge amounts of water, it takes tens of thousands of litres to produce 1kg of cotton, the equivalent of a single t shirt. Organic cotton uses far less water, lessening the impact on our environment as the crop is mainly rain fed rather than irrigated.<\/p>"
