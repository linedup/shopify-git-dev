Despite growing public awareness of the problem, the rate at which our societies produce plastic waste is not relenting, and there is so much already out there.<\/p><p>That’s why we believe we need to rethink how we view plastic waste; a material resource, not just pollution.<\/p><p>Plastic, polymer-based fabrics offer durability and high performance, extending the lifetime of a garment. However, they are extracted from petroleum, an unsustainable and finite resource. Producing fabrics made from recycled plastics reduces our reliance on fossil fuels, requires considerably less energy and water, and reduces air pollution.<\/p>"
