The material is then rinsed, milled down and dried, to be processed into bales of Yulex Pure® dry solid.

Switching the source of the material to a renewable plant based one, rather than a finite fossil fuel resource, not only ensures the long-term sustainability of the supply chain, it drastically reduces the environmental impact of producing the material.<\/p><p>Natural Carbon Sequestration<\/p><p>Because Yulex® comes from trees, the plantations are already sequestering huge amounts of carbon, with around 1,400 kgs of CO2 sequestered per hectare of forest.<\/p><p>10x Less Water Needed<\/p><p>Traditional neoprene requires a lot of water – around 300,000 litres to produce just one metric tonne. By comparison, one tonne of Yulex® can be made with just under 26,000 litres. That’s over 10x less water used.<\/p><p>Reduced Energy Consumption<\/p><p>It can take up to 33,300 kilowatt hours of energy to make one tonne of neoprene. To produce the same amount of Yulex®, only 1,150 kwh would be required.<\/p><p>Cuts Overall Carbon Footprint<\/p><p>There are other benefits too, like the fact that Yulex recycle any waste water in a closed loop system, or the use of renewable energy at their processing facilities. But all of these things add up, and manufacturing a wetsuit with Yulex®, rather than traditional neoprene, can reduce the overall carbon footprint of a suit by an incredible 80%.<\/p>"
